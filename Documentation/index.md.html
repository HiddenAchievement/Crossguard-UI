**Crossguard UI**
_UGUI Improved_

Crossguard UI is a Unity package that provides a variety of improvements to
Unity's stock UGUI behavior.

# Getting Started

Most of Crossguard UI works right out of the box, but there are a few things
you'll need to do to get the most out of it.


## Get the Package

This package depends on [LitMotion](https://github.com/annulusgames/LitMotion)
for tweening. You should add that to your project first, before proceeding.

The easiest way to use this package is by using the git bundle. Open the Unity
Package Manager (`Window > Package Manager`), and hit the + symbol in the upper
left of the window. Select `Add package from git URL...`. If you just want
to use whatever the latest package is, you can use this URL:

```
https://github.com/HiddenAchievement/Crossguard-UI.git
```

However, it's less risky to select a specific tag, so that you don't risk
encountering a breaking change. Every revision in the CHANGELOG has a tag. To
specify a tag, simply put a #, followed by the tag name, at the end of the URL.
For instance, this will use the 1.1.4 version:

```
https://github.com/HiddenAchievement/Crossguard-UI.git#v1.1.4
```

If you are doing development, you should probably pull the whole repository
into a folder next to your testing project, and reference it by file path,
instead.

## Prepare Your Project

If you are using Unity's new Input System package or Rewired, you should add UI
events for `PrevField` and `NextField`.  These are for tabbing between form
fields. They should generally not be remapped, at this time, because the Tab
handling for Input Fields is currently hard-coded, due to some limitations in
the input handling inside Unity's Input Field code.

### Preparing a Scene

If you are using either Unity's Legacy Input or Unity's new Input System
package, you should include a `Crossguard Input Adapter` in your scene.  This
doesn't need to be anywhere special:  It can go on any object that will be
present for the lifetime of the scene, such as a Scene Manager object.  This
object makes the `IPrevFieldHandler`, `INextFieldHandler`, and
`IMoveEndHandler` events work.

If you are using Rewired, you may need to write your own replacement for
`Crossguard Input Adapter` that can execute these same three events.

### Crossguard's UI Elements

To use a Crossguard UI [element](#uielements), you'll either want to use the
`GameObject > UI > Crossguard UI` menu (or the scene hierarchy context menu) to
create a fully-constructed object, or you'll want to build it from, scratch,
using the respective component.  Every Crossguard UI element requires a
[Transitioner](#transitioners), which dictates the visual behavior of state
transitions.  If you are building your element from scratch, you'll need to add
this component manually, since Crossguard does not know which one you want to
use.

Elements that can be controlled by axis controls (such as sliders and spinners)
also require an `Axis Control Helper` component, but this should automatically
be added, when your component is.

### Color and Scale Styles

If you're using a `Color And Scale Transitioner`, you need to make styles for
your elements.  To do this, go to `Assets > Create > Crossguard UI > Color and
Scale Style` (or use the project hierarchy context menu).  To learn more about
how to configure these, see the [Color and Scale Style](#colorandscalestyle)
part of the Transitioners section.

You can assign your new style to the `Style` field on the `Color And Scale
Transitioner` component.

The elements created from the `GameObject` menu use styles from the
`Content/Default Styles` folder inside of this package.  These are well-formed
examples, but you probably shouldn't use them in production.

### Controller Prompts (Optional)

If you intend to use Controller Prompts, you'll need a little additional
integration that isn't provided by Crossguard.  Specifically, you will need to
create a Token Provider and an Action Relay, compatible with whatever input
system you're using.  The test project includes `QuickAndDirtyTokenProvider.cs`
and `ControllerPromptActionTracker.cs` as examples for how to do these
integrations.  You can find more information on this in the
Gamepad Prompts section.

## Regression Test Changes

The `Crossguard UI Test` project is handy for regression-testing Crossguard
features.

# State System

Crossguard UI features a new, more sophisticated UI element state system.  The
biggest change is that the states are **not mutually-exclusive**. An element
can, for instance, be Selected, and if you mouse over it, it will _also_ be
Highlighted, at the same time.

## The States

The new states are as follows:

* **Normal** - The default state, which is always active.
* **Highlighted** - The state when the mouse is over the element.
* **Selected** - The state when an element is tab selected or game-controller selected.
* **Pressed** - The state when a mouse or finger is presssing the element.
* **Isolated** - The state when this element is isolated, such that it receives all navigation controls or typing.
* **Checked** - The state when this element is toggled on.
* **Disabled** - The state when this element cannot be interacted with.

## Order of Precedence

While the states may be mutually exclusive, two different states sometimes need
to alter the same properties on the same elements.  Because of this, the above
order of the states is important.  In most of the
[Transitioners](#transitioners) provided in this package, states lower in the
list will typically take precedence over states that are higher in the list.
For instance, if you're using the Color and Scale Transitioner, and your
`Disabled` state turns a button background gray, the `Highlighted` state cannot
change it to a different color, while the button is disabled.  When a state is
turned off, all of the elements that it modified will rise back up the list to
the first active state that has modifications for them.

So, you can think of these states as layers, in a way. When you turn a state on,
its changes apply on top of the changes in the states further up the list. The
`Normal` state is always active, and should contain settings for every setting
that is changed in other states.

## The Isolated State

Most of the above states serve the same purpose that they do in Unity, but
there is one new state that works a bit differently from the others.  The
Isolated state is intended to indicate situations where navigation has been
temporarily isolated to a given UI element.  The specific use-cases are as
follows:

### Isolating Axis Elements

One classic problem with using Gamepad or keyboard axis navigation in a UI
system is that certain elements, such as sliders and spinners, _also_ seem as
though they should be controlled using axis controls.  In Crossguard, if there
are navigation elements that are along the same axis as one of these elements
(or if you turn on `Always Require Isolation`), these elements require a
`Submit` button press to activate them, before they can be driven using your
axis controls.  When the element is activated, the `Isolated` state becomes
active.

Additionally, axis components have optional increment and decrement buttons
that can be assigned to them.  If these buttons are present, then these
buttons will _also_ enter the `1solated` state when the axis element does.
This helps illuminate the fact that these buttons are being driven by the axis
controls, at this point.

### Isolating Input Fields

Input fields use their `Isolated` state when they enter edit mode.  This
visually distinguishes them from when they are merely selected.  This is
especially handy when using Gamepad controls, since the controls do not go
immediately into edit mode when selected by the controller.


# UI Elements

Crossguard UI includes both enhanced versions of Unity's stock UGUI elements,
and some additional elements that aren't normally available in UGUI.

## Standard Elements

These are CrossGuard adaptations of existing UGUI elements.

### CrossSelectable

CrossSelectable is a child class of Selectable.  It can be used as a base class
for new elements that work with Crossguard Transitioners, or it can be used
as a component, just as it is.

### CrossButton

CrossButton is a child class of UGUI's Button.  It has been modified to work
with Crossguard Transitioners.  It also supports some special behavior, when
used as Increment/Decrement buttons for Axis Controls (which will be discussed
below).

### CrossToggle

CrossToggle is **not** a child class of UGUI's Toggle.  It had to be rewritten
to work with Crossguard's [Toggle Groups](#togglegroups).  Unlike
traditional Toggles, CrossToggles can be assigned an arbitrary ID, for internal
use.  It also has an additional value changed callback that can be used when
you want to know which toggle was fired.

### CrossUguiToggle

This is a legacy UGUI toggle that is compatible with Crossguard features.

### CrossSlider

CrossSlider is a child class of UGUI's Slider.  It has been modified to work
with Crossguard Transitioners, and it's also an [Axis Control](#axiscontrols).

### CrossDropdown

CrossDropdown is **not** a child of UGUI's Dropdown or `TMP_Dropdown`.  It has
been rewritten to work with CrossToggle, CrossScrollbar and Crossguard
Transitioners.

### CrossUguiDropdown

CrossUguiDropdown is a child class of UGUI's `TMP_Dropdown`, which works with
`CrossUguiToggle`, `CrossScrollbar` and Crossguard Transitioners, and attempts to
fix the selected item visibility bug in `TMP_Dropdown`.

### CrossInputField

CrossInputField is a child of `TMP_InputField`.  However, it has been modified
to work with Crossguard Transitioners, field-tabbing, and one more very
important feature:

When using axis-navigation (such as with a Gamepad), it requires a `Submit`
press to activate text input.  This will turn on the `Isolation` state, which
should give the element a different appearance, so you can clearly see when the
field has become editable.

### CrossScrollbar

CrossScrollbar is a child of UGUI's Scrollbar.  It has been modified to work
with Crossguard Transitioners, but it's also an [Axis Control](#axiscontrols).

## Extended Elements

These are frequently-used elements that have been added to the collection.

### CrossSlideToggle

![](images/slide_toggle.png)

This is a standard slide-toggle, which slides a handle to the left or right,
depending on whether the Toggle is off or on, respectively.

### CrossIconToggle

![](images/icon_toggle.png)

This toggle displays different images when it is on and off.

### CrossTextToggle

This toggle displays different text when it is on and off.

### CrossIconSpinner

![](images/icon_spinner.png)

The icon spinner allows you to select from an array of images.  This is an
[Axis Control](#axiscontrols).

### CrossNumberSpinner

![](images/number_spinner.png)

The number spinner lets you pick an integer from a range.  This is an
[Axis Control](#axiscontrols).

### CrossTextSpinner

![](images/text_spinner.png)

The text spinner lets you pick a string from a list of strings.  (This can be
used as a more console-friendly alternative to a dropdown.)  This is an
[Axis Control](#axiscontrols).

## Adding New Elements

Apart from `CrossSelectable`, there are a few other base classes available

### CrossToggleBase

If you want to make a new Toggle type, the easiest way is to derive from
`CrossToggleBase`.  This implements the vast majority of the logic you need for
a Toggle.  All you need to do is implement the `PlayEffect` function:

```csharp
protected override void PlayEffect(bool instant)
{
    // Your logic here.
}
```

For instance, if you were creating a turn-lever toggle, like the sort that used
to appear in old-style mechanical voting machines, you might use this function
to begin a rotation animation.

If you want to see some fully-worked examples of working child classes, check
these out:

* `CrossToggle.cs`
* `CrossSlideToggle.cs`
* `CrossIconToggle.cs`

### CrossSpinnerBase

If you want to make a new Spinner type, the easiest way is to derive from
`CrossSpinnerBase`.  This implements the vast majority of the logic you need
for a Spinner.  All you need to do is implement these attributes and functions:

```csharp
public override int Step { get; }

public override int Min { get; }

public override int Max { get; }

public override void UpdateVisuals() { }
```

`UpdateVisuals()` updates the appearance of the spinner when the value of the
spinner changes.

## Axis Controls

Sliders, Scrollbars, and Spinners are all axis-controls.  Axis-controls
are in vertical or horizontal configurations, and can be driven by axis
controls, on keyboard or gamepad controller.

The trouble with axis controls is that if you have other UI elements that
are in-line with the axis of your control, it can create an ambiguous
situation, where it's not clear whether the user intends to change the
value of the control, or whether they intend to navigate to the neighboring
UI element.

Because of this, Crossguard introduces the concept of Isolated Mode.  When
an Axis Control is in Isolated Mode, it captures all navigation events in
the axis of interest.  There is also a special [State](#statesystem)
associated with this mode, so that the user can visually see when it's
enabled. For Axis Controls, this mode is only used when using axis-navigation,
and not with mouse controls, where it's unnecessary.

Axis controls all have an `Axis Control Helper` component.

![](images/axis_control_helper.png)

The settings are:

**Always Require Isolation** - This will cause the Axis control to require
Isolation Mode, even if there are no ambiguous neighboring controls.  You
may want to use this for consistency, if you have some ambiguous and some
unambiguous controls in the same section.

**Decrement Button** - Any button assigned here will automatically be bound
to the Decrement function on the control.  Its Isolated and Disabled states
will be driven by the axis control.

**Increment Button** - Any button assigned here will automatically be bound
to the Increment function on the control.  Its Isolated and Disabled states
will be driven by the axis control.

**Repeat Delay** - When you press the increment/decrement buttons, this
determines the delay before the event starts repeating.

**Repeat Rate** - When you press the increment/decrement buttons, this
determines the number of times this will repeat per second.

### Axis Control Buttons

The Increment and Decrement buttons available to Axis Controls are optional,
where there are other ways to control the element (e.g. Sliders, Scrollbars),
but necessary, if you intend to use them in a Mouse/Touch context, but there is
no other means of input (e.g. Spinners).  If you assign an Increment and
Decrement button, these buttons will be automatically bound to the Increment
and Decrement button on the control.


As mentioned above, holding these buttons down will repeat the increment or
decrement actions, with a delay and repeat driven by the `Repeat Delay` and
`Repeat Rate` settings on the Axis Control Helper component.  The `Isolated`
and `Disabled` states on these buttons will also be driven by the Axis Control.
Additionally, these buttons will animate appropriately, when you use your
controller or keyboard to drive the Axis Control element.

!!! Tip
    **Troubleshooting Tip**: If your Increment and Decrement buttons are stuck
    in their down state, after using your controller/keyboard to drive an Axis
    Control, it's likely that the `MoveEnd` event is not being triggered.  See
    the Preparing a Scene section for more on this.


Increment and Decrement buttons do not need to be in the hierarchy of the
Axis Control to function. Moreover, you probably _do not_ want to drive any
changes to these buttons from the Transitioner on the Axis Control, because
they might interfere with the Transitioner on the buttons, themselves.

# Layout Helpers

Crossguard includes two MonoBehaviours to help with common layout needs:

## MultiAxisContentSizeFitter

This is an alternate version of ContentSizeFitter that can be configured to grow in one direction, up to a maximum,
and then grow in the other direction. This is useful for boxes (such as alerts) that need to be fitted to a string,
but which will look bad if they are at full width with a short string inside of them.

## ShrinkwrapLayoutElement

Normally, in UGUI, if you want to make a button fit to the string inside of it, you need to use a `HorizontalLayoutGroup`
or `VerticalLayoutGroup` to accomplish this. This is somewhat silly, since those are really designed for laying out
a collection of children. `ShrinkwrapLayoutElement` provides a more fit-to-purpose way to accomplish this goal. Simply
use it in place of the layout group, assign the Content field, set your padding, and it should do the job.

# Transitioners

Crossguard uses its own transition system, instead of the built-in transitions
in UGUI.

## Crossguard Transitioners

Rather than be limited to UGUI's 3 modes, Crossguard supports any kind of
Transitioner you can dream up.  A Transitioner simply need derive from
`AbstractTransitioner`, and support the Crossguard [states](#statesystem)
for it to work with the system.

Common properties across derivatives include:

* `Tab Before` and `Tab After` -- These are used for field-tabbing.  See the
  Navigation section for more on this.
* `Select on Enable` -- This indicates that this item should be selected, when
  it is enabled.  This is only used when we are axis-navigating, or when an
  element is in a tab-navigation scenario.
* `Selection Indicator` -- This is the object (if any) that should be used as
  the Selection Indicator for this element, when in an axis-navigation
  situation.  See the Selection Indicator section for more on this.

All other settings are unique to a specific Transitioner.

## Included Transitioners

There are three Transitioners included in Crossguard, intended to cover
everything that UGUI could do with transitioners (and more).

### Color and Scale

![](images/color_and_scale_trans.png)

The Color and Scale Transitioner allows you to describe Color, Alpha, and
Scale for as many sub-objects you want, within the hierarchy of your
element.  Because this can result in some complex style definitions,
Styles are stored in a Scriptable Object asset, which can be re-used on
as many similar elements as you would like.

#### Color and Scale Style

To create a new Style for your Transitioner, go to
`Assets > Create > Crossguard UI > Color and Scale Style` (or use the project
hierarchy context menu).  Then, assign your new Style to the `Style` field
on your component.

![](images/color_and_scale_style.png)

The Style object includes an entry for each of the [states](#statesystem)
supported by Crossguard.  You can add as many entries as you want within
a state, as long as they each correspond to a unique Graphic object
in the hierarchy.  All objects should have `RectTransform` components on them,
and any that have Color/Alpha changes should also have `CanvasRenderer`
components.

Each object listed in Crossguard should have its correct name written out,
exactly as it appears in the Unity hierarchy.  If an object is not an immediate
child of the root object, then the path to the object should be delimited by
the `/` character (as in the image, above).

To style the root object, itself, leave the name of the object blank, as seen
here:

![](images/root_object_blank.png)

In this example, the Image component on the root object will be turned orange.

A checkmark next to a value means that the value is actually being _used_.
All values without a checkmark will be completely ignored, so it doesn't
matter what they are set to.

It's a good idea to fully describe the default state of anything that is going
be changed in your `Normal` state, because this will help your objects recover
to their default state, when a [higher-priority](#orderofprecedence) state
is transitioned off.

Note that colors that are set by the Color and Scale Transitioner are
effectively multiplied by the base color of the Graphic which is being changed.
In light of this, it's a good idea to leave objects white, if you intend
to control their color with the Transitioner.

### Modular

![](images/modular_transitioner.png)

This is a newer, more sophisticated transitioner that allows you to employ a
broad variety of modular rules to define the appearance of a state.

Similar to the Color and Scale Transitioner, the Modular Transitioner uses a
style that is described in a Scriptable Object.

#### Modular Style

To create a new Style for your Transitioner, to go to
`Assets > Create > Crossguard UI > Modular Style` (or use the project hierarchy
context menu). Then, assign your new Style to the `Style` field in your
component.

![](images/modular_style.png)

This works similarly to the Color and Scale Style, where you provide paths to
components, and then describe what that component looks like. It is far less
compact than the Color and Scale Style, but the tradeoff is that you have a much
wider array of rules available to you. You can even add your own modules,
if what you need isn't supported.

Please see the [Modules](#toc11) section below, to learn more about what modules
are available, and how to create your own.

### Simple Sprite Swap

![](images/simple_sprite_swap.png)

The Simple Sprite Swap transitioner is an example transitioner that works
similarly to Unity's Sprite Swap transition.  Each [state](#statesystem)
has one Sprite associated with it, and this is assigned to the `Target`
image.  This Transitioner strictly follows the rules of
[precedence](#orderofprecedence) outlined in the State System section.

## Adding New Transitioners

To add a new Transitioner, make a child class of `AbstractTransitioner`.
This does the vast majority of everything you need.  This is the entirety of
what you need to implement, to make it go:

```csharp
protected virtual void InitializeStates() { }

protected abstract void ClearAllComponents();

protected abstract void ForceAppearance(InteractState state);

protected abstract void TransitionOn(InteractState state, bool immediate);

protected abstract void TransitionOff(InteractState state, bool immediate);
```

`InitializeStates()` is entirely optional. It gets called during `Awake()`,
and is a good place to put any pre-processing or cacheing of your transition
data that you wish to do.

`ClearAllComponents()` removes the visual effects of *all* states, including
`Normal`.

`ForceAppearance(InteractState state)` is used to immediately force an element
into a given state, even if `InitializeStates()` has never been called.  This
is primarily used inside the Editor to force the appearance of an uninitialized
element.

`TransitionOn(InteractState state, bool immediate)` is the function that
is called when a state is turned on.

`TransitionOff(interactState state, bool immediate)` is the function that is
called when a state is turned off.

If you need to see examples of how to use these,
`SimpleSpriteSwapTransitioner.cs` and `AnimationTransitioner.cs` are very
simple easy-to-read implementations that illustrate how much power you can get
out of a very short, sweet Transitioner script. `ColorAndScaleTransitioner.cs`,
in contrast, is a fully-worked example demonstrating a far more sophisticated
Transitioner.

# Navigation

## Mouse Navigation

Unlike in UGUI, Mouse navigation should work as-expected.  You should be able
to use UGUI's stock `Navigation` without leaving confusing selection highlights
everywhere.  An element that you have clicked on is considered "Selected"
by the event system, but this will be functionally invisible, unless an
element has [Tab Navigation](#tabnavigation) targets set up.  Mouseover
highlights should clean up properly when reactivating a deactivated element.

## Touch Navigation

This should work the same as Mouse Navigation, except that Highlighting is
turned off entirely on Mobile.  Unlike UGUI, you should never have errant
mouseover highlights hanging around on previously clicked elements.

## Axis Navigation

Axis Navigation will normally use UGUI's stick `Navigation` settings on the
UI elements.  If you perform Axis Navigation in a Mouse or Touch environment,
this should immediately enable the visibility of the Selection state and
[Selection Indicator](#selectionindicator), if one is configured.  (But
it will vanish again if a click is used, unless Tab Navigation is set up for
the element being clicked.)


## Tab Navigation

Every Transitioner has `Tab Before` and `Tab After` settings on them.  These
specify the elements that will be visited if you use `Shift-Tab` or `Tab` keys,
respectively.

These are, in most cases, based on `IPrevFieldHandler` and
`INextFieldHandler`, and you can remap what keys trigger this, but
unfortunately, due to technical limitations, the Tab key behavior is hard-coded
in the `CrossInputField` element, so you should probably stick to the
convention for this.

If anything is set in `Tab Before` or `Tab After`, the `Selected` state for
that element (and any [Selection Indicator](#selectionindicator)
configured for it) will always be visible, when that element is selected, even
if it is selected by mouse.

# Toggle Groups

## Cross Radio Group

![](images/cross_radio_group.png)

Cross Radio Group is primarily intended as a replacement for UGUI's `Toggle
Group`. However, it has a couple of important quality-of-life improvements.

First, it keeps track of the currently selected toggle, which can be
retrieved using the `SelectedToggle` parameter (`null` if there is no current
selection).  The Id of the selected toggle can also be retrieved with the `Id`
toggle. (`CrossRadioGroup.NoSelection` in the event that nothing is selected.)

Second, there is an `OnValueChanged` event on the group, itself, which you
can use to listen for when the selected toggle changes.

Cross Radio Group should work with any toggle which derives from
`CrossToggleBase`, and is not limited to `CrossToggle`.

## Adding New Toggle Groups

To implement a toggle group with different behavior, but compatible with
Crossguard's toggles, you need only create a child class of
`CrossToggleGroupBase`.  You will probably want to write your own
implementations of `AllowSwitchOff`, `NotifyToggleOn`, `NotifyToggleOff`,
`EnsureValidState`, and `SetAllTogglesOff`.

# Selection Indicator

![](images/selection_indicator.png)

To create a Selection Indicator, add the `Selection Indicator` component to
an object, and place it in the hierarchy where you would like it to appear,
mindful of the draw-order of elements.

The `Sizer` attribute should be a `RectTransform` in your Selection Indicator
that will be fitted to the object that is being selected.  (In most cases,
this will be the root object of the Selection Indicator.)

To use the Selection Indicator, simply assign it as the `Selection Indicator`
on the Transitioners for the objects that the indicator should apply to.
It will be visible in all cases in which the `Selected` state for an element
would normally be visible.

You may use as many Selection Indicators as you would like, in a given scene.
The `Selection Indicator` setting on the element Transitioners will always
dictate which indicator should be used, for any specific element.  The other
indicators will all be invisible, when they are not in-use.

# Gamepad Prompts

## Controller Prompt

Controller prompts are intended to provide a visual cue as to how to perform
a given Action in your game.  They can also be used to bind that Action
to a given Button, Toggle or other clickable element in your game.

![](images/controller_prompt.png)

`Action Name` is the Action you would like to bind this prompt to.

`Layer` specifies a group that this prompt belongs to that can be
pre-empted (say, for instance, if a dialog comes into the foreground).  More
on this in the Prompt Layers subsection, below.

`Selectable` is an optional  UI element to bind this prompt to.  If this
is set, then pressing and releasing the control associated with the Action will
press and release the Selectable assigned here.  This will perform any
events and transitions associated with this Selectable.

`Display` is a `TextMeshProUGUI` which displays the prompt art, itself.  The
reason we use a text-element for this is so that we have the flexibility to
use either sprite art, or an icon font to display the prompt.

If [set up properly](#settingupforuse), the prompt should automatically
update its appearance, based on the active input scheme, or should hide,
if no art token is provided for the prompt.

## Prompt Layers

Layers are a way for the prompt system to pre-empt prompts with the prompts
of a higher priority state or overlay.  To make a Layer the Active layer,
on the top of the layer stack, simply call
`ControllerPromptManager.PushLayer("LayerName")`, where `LayerName` is the
name of the layer that you would like to activate.

Any prompts that are not in the top layer will be effectively ignored, even
if the Actions fire.  However, the appearance of prompts in the background
layers will still change, if the input scheme changes.

When you are done with that layer (say, a scene has ended, or an overlay
has been hidden), you can `ControllerPromptManager.PopLayer("LayerName")`
to pop it from the top of the stack.

!!! WARNING
    **Known Issue**: The system will currenly only pop the top element off the
    stack if it matches the name passed into `PopLayer`.  However, it won't dig
    it out of the stack, if it's further down.  This should probably be
    addressed.

## Setting Up For Use

Using Controller Prompts requires a little more setup than the reset of
Crossguard UI, because it requires more integration with your input system
than the other pieces do. There is a `ControllerPromptManager` singleton that
acts as a nerve center for the Controller Prompts.  It is dependent upon
two additional pieces (which can optionally be combined, if you choose).

### Token Provider

The Token Provider is a piece of code that tells the Controller Prompts what
string should be used to display the appropriate sprite or icon font glyph
for a given control button.  The Token Provider should implement
`IControllerTokenProvider`.  Additionally either the Token Provider, or some
other code system, needs to call
`ControllerPromptManager.Instance.SetTokenProvider(provider)` and
`ControllerPromptManager.Instance.ClearTokenProvider(provider)`, to let the
`ControllerPromptManager` know what provider it should be using.

In the test project, there is an example of a working token provider, in the
`QuickAndDirtyTokenProvider.cs` file.  It's a low-quality example, but it at
least demonstrates how the token provider is intended to impelent its
interface.

### Action Relay

The Action Relay is a piece of code that tells the Controller Prompts when
the gamepad or other controller is firing an action they may be interested in.
It should implement `IControllerActionRelay`, and like the Token Provider, it
should call `ControllerPromptManager.Instance.SetActionRelay(relay)` and
`ControllerPromptManager.Instance.ClearActionRelay(relay)`.

The interface includes functions for registering/unregistering interest in
various actions that are bound to Controller Prompts.  When the buttons/keys
associated with these Actions are pressed, you should call
`ControllerPromptManager.Instance.PressControl(actionName)` and when they are
released, you should call
`ControllerPromptManager.Instance.ReleaseControl(actionName)`.

In the test project, there is an exmaple of a working Action Relay, in
`ControllerPromptActionRelay.cs` file. This specific one is designed to work
with Unity's new Input System package.

### Changing Devices

When the active device or control scheme changes, you should call
`ControllerPromptManager.Instance.RefreshTokens()` to force the prompts to
load in the new prompt art.

`QuickAndDirtyTokenProvider.cs` in the test project demonstrates this, in the
`UpdateTokenMap()` function.

# Omni Transitioner

![](images/omni_transitioner.png)

The Omni Transitioner isn't in the Transitioners section, because this is an
entirely different sort of thing. Instead of being intended for use with
Selectable components, it can be used with _any_ UI component (and possibly
even non-UI GameObjects, in some instances). Instead of using the stock
set of states available for the other Transitioners, the Omni Transitioner
allows you to define your own bespoke states. It is compatible with the same
modular rules that are used by the Modular Transitioner, so you have a
wide variety of things you can do with it.

Example use-cases for the Omni Transitioner might be slide-out panels,
toasts that pop in from an edge of the screen, or dialogs that expand or fade
in.

To use the Omni Transitioner, simply add an Omni Transitioner MonoBehaviour,
fill in the settings, and then add an Omni Transitioner State for each state
you'd like to support. States are described in the same manner as the Modular
Transitioner, except that you also have the ability to provide a name for
your state, and an Easing setting.

To change these states, there are a variety of public functions. If you have
only two states, you can set them with boolean values, and if you have more than
two, you can set them with an integer value.

# Transitioner Modules

CrossguardUI includes a large variety of Transitioner Moodules, which can be used with the Modular Transitioner and the
Omni Transitioner. You can also add new ones. They are generally categories by what type of MonoBehaviour they act
on.

![Toplevel module categories](images/toplevel_module_categories.png)

## Canvas Group Modules

### Alpha

Specifies the alpha value on a Canvas Group, so that you can fade a GameObject and all of its children in or
out at the same time. Value should be in the 0-1 range.

## Canvas Renderer Modules

### Alpha

Specifies the alpha on a single Canvas Renderer (typically a GameObject with an Image, RawImage, or
TextMeshProUGUI), so that you can fade it in or out. Value should be in the 0-1 range.

### Color RGB

Specifies the color of a single Canvas Renderer (typically a GameObject with an Image, RawImage, or
TextMeshProUGUI). It ignores the alpha values on the colors provided. The color will be multiplied with any sprites
or colors already defined on the GameObject.

### Color RGBA

Specifies the color and alpha of a single Canvas Renderer (typically a GameObject with an Image, RawImage, or
TextMeshProUGUI). The color will be multiplied with any sprites or colors already defined on the GameObject.

## Image Modules

### Fill

Specifies the Fill Amount for an Image that has been set to the Filled image type. Value should be in the 0-1 range.

### Sprite

Specifies the sprite assigned to a given Image. This happens immediately, regardless of the transition duration. However,
we're considering adding data to the rule so that you can specify how far through the transition the image should be
swapped.

## Transform Modules

### Local Rotation

Specifies the Local Rotation of the object Transform. This is defined as an Euler angle rotations in degrees. When using
this with UI elements, the you will usually be rotating around the Z-axis, and rotation will occur around the current
RectTransform Pivot.

### Local Scale

Specifies the Local Scale of the object Transform. For UI elements, scaling will us ethe current Pivot as the scaling
anchor. For instance, if your pivot is on the left side of a button, and you scale it up, it will scale rightward.

## RectTransform Modules

### Anchored Position

Specifies the Anchored Position of the RectTransform.

### Anchor Min

Specifies the Anchor Min (x, y) of the RectTransform. This can be useful for moving things without knowing absolute
distances.

### Anchor Max

Specifies the Anchor Max (x, y) of the RectTransform. This can be useful for moving things without knowing
absolute distances. It can also be used for growing something from a side or upper corner.

### Pivot

Specifies the Pivot of the RectTransform. This is incredibly useful for making elements slide out of the sides
of the screen, or out from behind other elements, though it can also be used for small slides and wiggles, and a
variety of other effects.

## Custom Modules

Every Module is defined by three parts: The Module, the ModuleRule, and the ModuleRuleDrawer. Once you've defined
all three files, you have everything you need to use your new Module.

To demonstrate how this works, let's invent a Module for changing the UV position of a Raw Image. Well call this the
RawImageUvModule.

First, we should make `RawImageUvPositionModule.cs` and `RawImageUvPositionModuleRule.cs`.

The Module file describes the logic that performs the transition, and the Rule file describes the data that will be
used to define transition target, and also a little bit of factory logic for providing Crossguard with a Module, to
act on that data.

Here's our `RawImageUvPositionModule.cs`:

```cs
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.UI;
using LitMotion;
using HiddenAchievement.CrossguardUi;
using HiddenAchievement.CrossguardUi.Modules;

namespace MyApplicationDomain
{
    public class RawImageUvPositionModule : IStyleModule
    {
        // We usually pool these modules, to reduce allocations.
        private static readonly CrossInstancePool&lt;RawImageUvPositionModule&gt; s_pool =
            new(() => new RawImageUvPositionModule());
    
        private readonly Dictionary&lt;Transform, RawImage&gt; _componentCache = new();
    
        // This is a LitMotion handle, which we can use to cancel our animation.
        private MotionHandle _motionHandle = MotionHandle.None;
    
        public static RawImageUvPositionModule Create()
        {
        // This creates a new module by fetching from our pool.
        return s_pool.Fetch();
        }
    
        /// &lt;inheritdoc /&gt;
        public void Free()
        {
        // This frees our module by returning it to the pool.
        s_pool.Return(this);
        }
    
        /// &lt;inheritdoc /&gt;
        public void CacheComponent(Transform component)
        {
            // We cache our RawImage components, so we don't need to look them up
            // constantly.
            RawImage image = component.GetComponent&lt;RawImage&gt;();
            Debug.Assert(image != null);
            _componentCache[component] = image;
        }
    
        /// &lt;inheritdoc /&gt;
        public void ClearComponent(Transform component)
        {
            // This is used at design-time in the editor, so we don't have our cache
            // populated here.
            RawImage image = component.GetComponent&lt;RawImage&gt;();
            if (image == null) return;
            image.uvRect = new Rect(0, 0, 1, 1); 
        }
    
        /// &lt;inheritdoc /&gt;
        public void ForceComponentRule(Transform component, IStyleModuleRule rule)
        {
            // This is used at design-time in the editor, so we don't have our cache
            // populated here.
            if (rule is not RawImageUvPositionModuleRule uvRule) return;
            RawImage image = component.GetComponent&lt;RawImage&gt;();
            if (image == null) return;
            SetUvRectPosition(uvRule.UvPosition, image);
        }

        /// &lt;inheritdoc /&gt;
        public void Transition(Transform component, IStyleModuleRule rule)
        {
            // Since no duration is defined, this is an immediate transition, with
            // no animation.
            if (rule is not RawImageUvPositionModuleRule uvRule) return;
            RawImage image = _componentCache[component];
            if (image == null) return;
            SetUvRectPosition(uvRule.UvPosition, image);
        }

        /// &lt;inheritdoc /&gt;
        public void Transition(Transform component, IStyleModuleRule rule,
            float duration, Ease easing)
        {
            if (rule is not RawImageUvPositionModuleRule uvRule) return;
            RawImage image = _componentCache[component];
    
            // This is where the actual tween happens!
            _motionHandle = LMotion.Create(image.uvRect.position, uvRule.UvPosition,
                duration)
            .WithEase(easing)
            .Bind(image, SetUvRectPosition);
        }

        private static void SetUvRectPosition(Vector2 position, RawImage target)
        {
            // LitMotion comes with a lot of built-in binding extensions, but we
            // didn't have one for this case. That's fine, since we were able to
            // re-use this logic in a few different places.
            Rect rect = target.uvRect;
            rect.position = position;
            target.uvRect = rect;
        }

        /// &lt;inheritdoc /&gt;
        public void Reset()
        {
            // This gets run when we return modules to the pool.
            StopTween();
            _componentCache.Clear();
        }

        private void StopTween()
        {
            if (_motionHandle != MotionHandle.None && _motionHandle.IsPlaying())
            {
                _motionHandle.Cancel();
            }
            _motionHandle = MotionHandle.None;
        }

        // We're hiding this away, because folks should use Create.
        private RawImageUvPositionModule()
        {}
    } 
}
```

Now here's our rule file,`RawImageUvPositionModuleRule.cs`:

```cs
using System;
using UnityEngine;
using HiddenAchievement.CrossguardUi;
using HiddenAchievement.CrossguardUi.Modules;

namespace MyApplicationDomain
{
    [Serializable]
    // Describes where to put this in our Module menu.
    [StyleModuleRule("RawImage/UV Position")]
    public class RawImageUvPositionModuleRule : IStyleModuleRule
    {
        // Our data value.
        public Vector2 UvPosition;
        
        // These help us fetch the right Module to go with our data.
        public Type ModuleType => typeof(RawImageUvPositionModule);
        public IStyleModule GetModuleInstance() => RawImageUvPositionModule.Create();
    }
}
```

Finally, in an Editor folder, we can make `RawImageUvPositionModuleDrawer.cs`. We need this for displaying our rule
neatly in the editor, where it is used.

```cs
using UnityEditor;
using UnityEngine;

namespace MyApplicationDomain
{
    [CustomPropertyDrawer(typeof(RawImageUvPositionModuleRule))]
    public class RawImageUvPositionModuleRuleDrawer : PropertyDrawer
    {
        public override void OnGUI(Rect position, SerializedProperty property,
            GUIContent label)
        {
            EditorGUI.BeginProperty(position, label, property);
            // This is what will appear in the inspector.
            label.text = "Uv Position";
            // The name given here must match the name, spelling, and capitalization
            // in our Rule file.
            EditorGUI.PropertyField(position,
                property.FindPropertyRelative("UvPosition"), label);
            EditorGUI.EndProperty();
        }
    }
}
```

If you Add Rule on any Omni Transitioner State or Modular Style, you'll now find that there's a `RawImage` section
which includes our new Module type.

![](images/raw_image_module.png)

And now we can add this rule to a state, and fill it in with our values.

![](images/raw_image_module2.png)

Here we've set up two states on an Omni Transitioner, and hooked a toggle up to `SetValue`, so we can see it in action:

# Known Issues

This section contains a list of any reamining issues that haven't been
addressed yet.

## The CrossFade Blues

If you have an element that uses `Graphic.CrossFadeAlpha` or
`Graphic.CrossFadeColor` internally (CrossToggle, for instance), it may
conflict with the `Color And Scale Transitioner`, if they are attempting to
tween the same element.

If we ever need to fix this, we will probably need to add some functionality to
the transitioner to cooperate with other color/alpha tweens.

For now, the best way to work around it is to avoid including these elements
in your transitions, or make their changes (either on the Transitioner or on
the competing animation) instantaneous.

## Multi-Editing

Some Cross-elements are not currently capable of multi-editing.  To support
this, we're going to have to make custom editors for all our elements, which
we haven't done yet.

## Replacer Scripts

We don't yet have any scripts for automatically replacing UGUI elements
with equivalent Crossguard elements.  However, this would be very nice
to have.
